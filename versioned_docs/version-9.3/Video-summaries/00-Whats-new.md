title: What's new - Paratext 9.3
sidebar_position: 1
---
:::caution
Please be aware that this is a Beta and some things may/will change before Paratext 9.3 is released.
::: 
### Paratext Live
Paratext Live uses a couple of servers.

- Paratext 8, 9.0 and 9.1 use a server called Internet (secondary) WCF and Paratext 9.2 uses Internet (primary) AMQP.  
   -  *This is why you can't use Paratext Live with 9.2 and 9.1 at the same time*

- In Paratext 9.3 when you start Paratext live you choose what server you want to use.
  - **Internet (primary)**, which is 9.2 and 9.3.
  - **Internet (secondary)** which is 9.0, 9.1 or Paratext 8.  

:::note
Everyone in a particular live session still needs to use the same server, it is just that from 9.3 you can work with someone on 9.1 or someone else on 9.2 (just not at the same time)
:::

### Study Bible Additions
The most obvious new feature the ability to **compare versions**.

- Open a Study Bible Additions project
- From the **Project** menu, 
- Under **Project**, choose **Compare Versions**  
  *The changes in the additions are displayed*.

### Scripture reference in navigation bar
In Paratext 9.3 you can copy and paste a scripture reference into the navigation bar.
- Copy the text of a reference (from another file)
- Click in the **book name** in the navigation bar
- Paste using **Ctrl+V**  
   ![](./media/paste-reference-2.png)
   
The reference should be in a format that matches the interface language.

For example, 
  - in English: MAT 12.3, Mrk 5:4, Galatians 1:12
  - in Spanish: Romanos 8:28

:::note
The names must matches the names as they are seen in the titles.  
Currently can't copy from Paratext, but that feature is being added to a later update.
